			<em>Give your children the gift of a lifetime- learning a

			<h2>Why learn Spanish?</h2>
			<img src="img/twoBoys.jpg" alt="campus" />

			<p>With over 35 million Spanish speakers in the United States,
				the U.S. has the 5th largest Spanish-speaking population. In today's
				diverse work environment, speaking Spanish is always preferred and
				often required as part of many careers. Learning Spanish will open
				many doors and provide you with an instant competitive advantage.
				Due to the similarity between English and Spanish words and because
				written Spanish is almost completely phonetic, it is one of the
				easiest foreign languages to learn. Improve skills to communicate in
				multiple languages in order to devise and exchange ideas clearly and
				effectively. Acquire knowledge and critical appreciation of the
				diversity of human cultural and social experiences.</p>

			<h2>Our Program</h2>
			<img src="img/faces.jpg" alt="campus" />
			<p>Make your next family trip a learning vacation! Experience the
				beautiful city of Guanajuato, Mexico while simultaneously enriching
				your children’s lives with language and Mexican culture!</p>

			<p>Immerse your child in a new language and give them an
				experience they will never forget. Guanajuato is an excellent
				location to immerse your children in the Spanish language. It is
				extremely safe and child-friendly. Most of the city is accessible by
				foot. Many of our host families can also accommodate entire
				families- the perfect way to complement your children’s Spanish
				studies! Many families also have children that either live in the
				home, or visit frequently, so it will give your child more
				opportunities to play in Spanish!</p>

			<p>Besides their Spanish classes during the day, children will
				have the opportunity to participate in many other activities. Kids
				love our visits to museums with teachers, craft activities such as
				piñata and Mexican-kite making, a visit to the largest market in
				Guanajuato, city-scavenger hunts and weekend trips to nearby cities
				and towns. The large range of activities outside of our school will
				not only help your children apply the language they learn in class
				in a real-world context, but also give them a chance to experience
				Mexican culture, history, and traditions first-hand. Programs are
				offered for six weeks for the children between the age group of 12
				to 18. Following are the programs offered :</p>

					Spanish-speaking peoples. It explores the development of regional
					differences in popular culture, as well as the changes in the
